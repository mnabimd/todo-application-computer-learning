    1. Routes
            Purpose: Define what URL the client can call and which controller should run.
            
            Think of it as: The API endpoints — just the “address”.
    2. Controllers
            Purpose: The logic behind each route.
            They process the request, call services/DB, and return a response.  
            
            Think of it as: The “main logic” for each endpoint.
    3. Middlewares
            Purpose: Functions that run before the controller.
            Used for auth, validation, logging, etc.
    4. Utils
            Purpose: Reusable helper functions that are NOT specific to routes/controllers.
            Utility functions to keep logic clean.

T           hink of it as: Tools — anything that helps the project but is not tied to Express directly.
